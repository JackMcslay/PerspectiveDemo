# PerspectiveDemo
This is a simple javascript demo demonstrating how a perspective grid should be 
laid out on a drawing/painting application. Drag the black circles around and it 
will set up perspective lines according to how the perspective should be laid 
out along the represented surface, as well as showing the vanishing points.
